# MATH 307 Applied Linear Algebra

[MATH 307](https://courses.students.ubc.ca/cs/courseschedule?pname=subjarea&tname=subj-course&dept=MATH&course=307) is an introduction to applied linear algebra including:

* Linear systems of equations: LU and Cholesky decompositions and conditioning
* Least squares approximation: normal equations, QR decomposition and orthogonalization
* Eigenvalue problems: spectral theorem, singular value decomposition and eigenvalue algorithms
* Digital signal processing: discrete Fourier transform, fast Fourier transform and the convolution theorem
* Applications: interpolation, finite difference method, data fitting, computed tomography, image processing, signal processing, network analysis, PageRank and more
